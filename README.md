# socialNetworkAPI
This project builds an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. No seed data was provided, so I created my own data using Insomnia after I created my API.
